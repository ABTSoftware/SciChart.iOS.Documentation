# Build Tutorials
The process of building tutorials is fairly simple.
Thanks to [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) you can just build & run the project you are interested in.
No additional steps required.

There's a workspace which contains a separate scheme for each tutorial. 
Just select the scheme you want to try and you are good to go.
