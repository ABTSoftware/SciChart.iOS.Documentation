# Setting up a Development Environment
The following section shows how to setup a development environment for working with SciChart iOS.

## XCode
We recommend the [XCode IDE](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) as it is the defacto standard for working on iOS Applications. However, you may also be interested in the JetBrains [AppCode IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/), which is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, and provides superior features for inspecting and navigating code, as well as supporting profiling and debugging of iOS devices. Also, if you developing cross-platform Android/iOS apps using Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.Android, you might want to look for [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/xamarin/) which allows to develop rich native experiences for Android, macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS with first-class support for Xamarin.

### Installing XCode IDE
Probably you have it already installed, but if not then follow these simple steps to get it. You can download and install it from AppStore or you can visit  https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/, which will take you to AppStore with opened link to XCode.
