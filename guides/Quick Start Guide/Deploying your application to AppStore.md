# Deploying your application to App Store
The following section shows how to publish an application, with manually linked **SciChart.framework** to AppStore.

## Framework linked via Cocoapods
If you are linked SciChart.framework to your app via cocoapods, you don't need to perform any actions during publishing, as cocoapods handles embeded Universal Libraries for you.

## Framework linked manually
Since SciChart iOS & macOS is distributed as XCFramework, there's nothing you should do befor submitting your app to the Mac/iOS AppStore.
